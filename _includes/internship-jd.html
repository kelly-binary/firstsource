      <p>Interns at First Source Arya Solutions are valuable contributors that make an impact from Day 1. You’ll be working on complex and challenging problems that affect award-winning online products and services that are used by millions of people worldwide.</p>
      <p class="title">About First Source Arya Solutions LLC</p>
      <p>First Source Arya Solutions is a startup with big ambitions. We’re on a mission to transform the global financial industry by developing state-of-the-art software solutions that make financial services more accessible to everyone.
</p>
      <p>Working at First Source gives you more responsibilities and opportunities to help you realise your full potential. You’ll be able to learn and improve every day from doing a lot of different things in a fast-paced, startup environment that values tenacity, creativity, and hard work.
      </p>
      <p>We believe that software plays an essential role in every business –– especially for financial institutions that manage millions in transactions each day.</p>
      <p>We constantly push the boundaries of what’s possible to deliver cutting-edge products and services that can solve problems, meet challenges, and transform a business. We build great software not as the end goal, but as the means to an end.
</p>
      <p class="title">The ideal candidate</p>
<p>Our interns –– just like our full-time employees –– must possess specific qualities that allow them to fit in seamlessly with our culture and values.
</p>
<p>We’re looking for smart, self-motivated, and proactive individuals who can:
  <ul class="dashed">
    <li>Thrive in a dynamic and collaborative environment</li>
    <li>Approach even the smallest task with an open mind</li>
    <li>Value the importance of constant, open, and honest communication</li>
    <li>Solve problems creatively and proactively</li>
    <li>Do great work, and inspires people around them to do the same</li>
    <li>Work with highly talented people in an exciting, multinational environment</li>
    <li>Get things done in a no-nonsense manner</li>
    <li>Work without bureaucracy and hierarchy</li>
    <li>Learn and improve, day in and day out</li>
  </ul>
<p class="title">What you’ll be doing at First Source Arya Solutions</p>
<p>At First Source, you’ll be given ample opportunity to solve problems and challenges that have a direct impact on users and revenue.</p>
<p>We’re a small company and this allows you to see and learn almost everything that’s related to the technical side of online trading. Nothing beats hands-on experience though and we encourage you to try your hand at different disciplines if you believe that you can make a bigger impact doing something outside your comfort zone.</p>
<p>Our team-first, collaborative culture will make sure that you are given the support you need to deliver results and take that next step in your career.</p>
